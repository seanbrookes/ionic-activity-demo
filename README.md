===================

demo for issues around rendering activity indicator directive

If the round progress directive is included in a page with no ionic directives the canvas renders and the path info is drawn on the canvas

If the round progress directive is embedded within an ionic directive (eg: tab view) the canvas element is rendered but nothing is written to it.
